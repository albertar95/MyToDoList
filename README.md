# MyToDoList project

if you need an web application to manage your weekly duties and track your activuties,this is what you are searching for.in this application you can create a goal,define how much time you want to dedicate to this goal weekly or daily,create tasks that will guide you to accompolish this goal.
also you can add progresses on tasks.

in this project i've use asp.net core and web api to develop and its database is sql server.because the bussiness layer is designed with web api you can add another UI app like android application too.
